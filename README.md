- Aiming for Exceeded Expectations
- Code has been separated into two files for redability:
   - script.js - contains the creation of the pagination menu, search menu and the addition of the respective event listeners.
   - functions.js - contains the functions used to achieve both the pagination and search functionality as well as some key
                    global variables. 
- On load, pagination menu is created and the first page is displayed.
- On search, results matching search query are returned and the first page is shown. In the event no matching students exist, a 'No Results Found' message is shown to the user. 

- An additional 100students.html file has been added to the project to demonstrate pagination functionality works even if the search returns more than 1 page of results. Use 'a' as an example.
